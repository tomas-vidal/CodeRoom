# CodeRoom: A Collaborative Coding Web App

CodeRoom is a web app designed for real-time collaborative JavaScript coding. It allows users to write, share, and edit JavaScript code together in a virtual "room". By entering a unique room code, users can instantly collaborate, with all code changes visible to everyone in the room in real time. This project was created as an experiment using WebSockets (via SignalR) to go beyond the typical chat app.

Users can invite others to join their room by sharing the room code, enabling seamless collaboration for pair programming or group coding projects.

# Future Implementations:

- **Mouse Tracking:** Visual indicators of where every participantâ€™s mouse is located within the code, similar to how Google Docs highlights cursors. This feature will help users follow along with what others are focusing on and enhance real-time interaction. Each user will have a unique colored cursor, making it easier to identify who is interacting with which part of the code, similar to collaborative tools like Google Docs.

- **Text Highlighting:** When someone highlights a portion of the code (for emphasis or discussion), it will be visible to everyone in the room. This will make collaboration smoother by allowing users to easily highlight and comment on specific code sections.

- **Change History:** A way to track changes made by participants, enabling users to view past versions of the code. This feature would allow for more advanced collaboration, with the ability to revert or compare changes as needed.
