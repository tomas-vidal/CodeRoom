# CodeRoom: A Collaborative Coding Web App

CodeRoom is a real-time collaborative coding web app that enables users to write and share code together in a virtual "room". When you enter a room by inputting a unique code, you’re able to see and interact with the code in real time alongside others. All code written by anyone in the room is immediately visible to everyone, ensuring smooth collaboration and instant feedback.

By sharing the same room code, users can invite others to join the same collaborative space, making it easy to pair up or work together on coding projects.

# Future Implementations:

- **Mouse Tracking:** Visual indicators of where every participant’s mouse is located within the code, similar to how Google Docs highlights cursors. This feature will help users follow along with what others are focusing on and enhance real-time interaction. Each user will have a unique colored cursor, making it easier to identify who is interacting with which part of the code, similar to collaborative tools like Google Docs.

- **Text Highlighting:** When someone highlights a portion of the code (for emphasis or discussion), it will be visible to everyone in the room. This will make collaboration smoother by allowing users to easily highlight and comment on specific code sections.

- **Change History:** A way to track changes made by participants, enabling users to view past versions of the code. This feature would allow for more advanced collaboration, with the ability to revert or compare changes as needed.
